This FSO was originally developed by `MMM/NCAR  <https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/>`_. 
The framework was written for performance in the real world, 
with many of the original scripts, codes, and
sub-systems borrowed from the code-base of `WRF Data Assimilation System
<http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/wrfda/>`_. 
It was, for years, developed and maintained by 北京朗润知天科技有限公司 
and a group of enthusiastic scientists and researchers.
